Digital Ocean Ubuntu 24.10 x64 Droplet with "Regular Intel" CPU, 512 MB Memory / 10 GB Disk
 
Running:
 git clone https://github.com/RafalSc007er/CHR.git
 cd CHR/
 chmod +x make-chr.sh
 ./make-chr.sh

 
Once the reboot is done, login with root/CHANGEME and change the password!
You might get a "Segmentation fault".
Most of the time this is absolutely fine. Reboot the droplet and attempt to login using Winbox.
If it didn't work, just trash the droplet and try it again.
